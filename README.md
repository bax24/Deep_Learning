# INFO8010-1
# Deep Learning

The goal of this project is to recognize transcription factor from proteic sequences. 
It has been made as part of our *[Deep Learning](https://www.programmes.uliege.be/cocoon/20202021/en/cours/INFO8010-1.html)* 
course which is given by **Gilles Louppe** at [University of Li√®ge](https://www.uliege.be/).

## Content
* The data folder contains the processed raw data in several .csv files.
* The utils.py file contains all the necessary functions that will be used by our models.
* Naive.py contains the implementation of the basic NN which uses the amino-acids frequencies.
* RNN.py contains the implementation of the RNNs.
